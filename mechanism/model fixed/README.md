For some types of 3D printer, there might be a requirement of minimun thickness at the edges that connect surfaces. 
If you find that components crack due to the thickness issue, try the fixed model in this folder.

`body_center.stl`: redesign a flat surface for angle sensor.


`body_top.stl`: added 4 holes for RaspbPi assembling.


`foot_ground_1.STL` & `foot_ground_2.STL` & `foot_ground_3.STL`: more styles


`thigh_bottom.stl `: increased thickness near screw hole where 3D printer may fail to print


`leg_bottom.STL `: increased thickness screw hole where 3D printer may fail to print
